This repository provides some sample code that you can use to build a simple client/server application. We'll be providing a more mature version of this repository with contents more specifically adapted for the theme of the hackathon closer to the event. Until then, you can use this repository to practice with something similar to what we'll be providing on the day of the event. Keep in mind that you don't have to use the sample code that we're providing to build your solution - this is here to help you get started faster, not to restrict you, and if you're more comfortable doing something else then you should feel free to do so.

# Using this repository
This repository contains a web client and four server applications. In order to use it, you'll need the web client and at least one of the servers. Specifically, we recommend that you do the following:

- Create a `project` directory.
- Copy the `hack4change-client` directory into the `project` directory.
- Follow the `README.md` instructions in the `hack4change-client` directory in order to get the client up and running.
- Copy one of the `hack4change-server-*` directories into the `project` directory.
- Follow the `README.md` instructions in the copied server directory to get your chosen server application running.
- Using the instructions from the `README.md` files, launch both the server and client that you've selected.

You should now be able to access the web client at `http://localhost:5173`, and the web client should be able to fetch data from your chosen server and display its welcome message as a header at the top of the page.
